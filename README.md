### Chess

This is a well performing C++ chess environment for RL. It should work almost identical to [Pettingzoo's Chess Env](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/environments/classic/chess/). It is still missing draw by insufficient material. But other than that it is complete.

It exists because I needed a fast ChessEnv that can be accessed from python for my implementation of [AlphaZero](https://github.com/MoritzSchwerer/Alpha_Zero). 
I plan to improve upon the library in the future but it may never come to that.
