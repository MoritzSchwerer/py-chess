### Chess

This is a well performing C++ chess library with bindings for python.

It exists because I needed a fast Chess library that can be accessed from python for my implementation of [AlphaZero](https://github.com/MoritzSchwerer/Alpha_Zero). 
I plan to improve upon the library in the future but it may never come to that.
